# conversions

This repo contains answers to two questions.

First question requires to transform the characters of any given string into an integer, mapped with respect to the definition of a character bank object, ('charBank').
The way this is implemented, the same mutated string is returned, not a copy of the argument passed.

The second question asks to identify and return the number of occurences of consequent characters in a given argument string.
This function does not mutate the original provided string, instead it returns another one.
